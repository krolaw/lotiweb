<h1>LoTI</h1>

<h2>Lottery Ticket Inspector</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>LoTI is the ultimate lottery analysis tool.</p>

<p>While most apps generate tickets, LoTI can measure ticket spread, allowing you to decide which tickets are the best. LoTI also can generate higher than average spread tickets - which you can of course test yourself. It also highlights the least performing and the greatest performing ticket rows for each division, along with allowing you to temporarily omit rows or divisions to see how spread is affected.</p>
    
<p>Supports most lottery types, either choose from a (short but growing) list or build your own to match your local lottery.</p>
    
<p>Completely standalone, all processing done on phone, no internet connection required!</p>
